NOTE: This mod requires RedGear Core! Please read the Installation section!

Brewcraft is a brewing overhaul for Minecraft. It does not replace vanilla mechanics, but rather adds in a new brewing system that accompanies the vanilla brewing stand. It produces liquid potions which can, in turn, be bottled for quick use.
